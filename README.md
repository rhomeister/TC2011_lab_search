# TC2011 - Uninformed Search Lab

## Setup

- Setup your Git identity. Every team member must do this, because every team
  member will contribute to the code. Follow these steps:
    - `$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
    - `$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
- Create a file `team.txt` with the names of your team members. One on each line
- Write your program to read input from stdin. A quick Google search will give 
  you the information you need to set this up for the programming language you 
  want to use.
- Edit the `run` file so your program will be called.
- Make your first commit.
- Run `autograder`. This will (among other things) run your program against the
  examples in the `testcases` directory. Explanation of how these test cases
  should be interpreted can be found in the syllabus.
